Socket lets program talk over the network
Can send and receive mesages between computers
This virtual switch program uses sockets to send and receive UDP packets

sys can read command line arguments, stop the program, print errors etc.
Used to read port numbers from command line arguments. 
Ports: number that tells a computer which program a message is meant for. 
So, IP address tells which computer, port number tells which program on that computer.

Creating a socket for the program to use for sending and receiving data. ".socket()" constructor method creates a new socket object (from socket class in socket module).
".socket(family, type)" takes two arguments:
- family: what kind of address (e.g., IPv4 or IPv6)
- type: what kind of connection (e.g., TCP or UDP)

both are constants:
socket.AF_INET: means "use IPv4 addresses" (like 127.0.0.1 or 10.1.1.101)
socket.SOCK_DGRAM: means "use UDP (User Datagram Protocol),‚Äù which sends small packets fast without checking if they arrived.

"""
.recvfrom() method waits for a UDP packet (Ethernet frame wrapped in UDP) to arrive. 
input parameters: maximum size of Ethernet frame in bytes. In my case 1518 bytes. The largest chunk of data to expect. 

output: 
data: contains the actual bytes of the UDP packet that was received.
vport or sender address: a tuple (IP, port) of the VPort (client) that sent it. example: ('192.168.1.5', 40000).

UDP: method of sending data. 
Ethernet frame is the actual data in bytes. For example b'\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\x11\x11\x11\x11\x11\x11\x08\x00HelloWorld...'

ethernet headers are 14 bytes long. 
so, we are grabbing those 14 and extracting the Destination MAC (Bytes 0-5), Source MAC (Bytes 6-11), and EtherType (Bytes 12-13).


Example: ethernet_header[06:12] = b'\x11\x22\x33\x44\x55\x66'. each \x means a byte written in hexadecimal.
So, a loop (x for x in eth_header[6:12]) would return x = 0x11, x = 0x22,x = 0x33, x = 0x44, x = 0x55, x = 0x66.
"{:02x}".format(x)": This converts each byte (x) to a two-digit hexadecimal lowercase string. 
Example: "{:02x}".format(255) = FF.
join() takes this list of strings anf combines them using ":" as a separator.
