Socket lets program talk over the network
Can send and receive mesages between computers
This virtual switch program uses sockets to send and receive UDP packets

sys can read command line arguments, stop the program, print errors etc.
Used to read port numbers from command line arguments. 
Ports: number that tells a computer which program a message is meant for. 
So, IP address tells which computer, port number tells which program on that computer.

sys.argv: is a list of words after typing "python3". For example, if i type "python3 vswitch.py 8080" then sys.argv = ["vswitch.py", "8080"]. 
So, the following if statement checks if i typed exactly 2 words after "python3". And stops the program with sys.exit(1).
The print statement tells the user how to use the program correctly.

Creating a socket for the program to use for sending and receiving data. ".socket()" constructor method creates a new socket object (from socket class in socket module).

- family: what kind of address (e.g., IPv4 or IPv6)
- type: what kind of connection (e.g., TCP or UDP)

both are constants:
socket.AF_INET: means "use IPv4 addresses" (like 127.0.0.1 or 10.1.1.101)
